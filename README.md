# CountriesApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.0.

## Description
- Styled with pure css, without any preprocessor or framework/library.
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/) is used for fetching countries data.
- The application consists of two pages: the home page and the detail page.
- The home page consists of a list of all countries, a search by name, a filter by region and pagination. Because  there is no pagination on the backend, i made a custom pagination on the frontend.
- Clicking on the country takes you to the details page.
- The details page consists of a back button and county details.
- Clicking on the back button takes you back to the home page.
- Clicking on the border country button displays details about that country.
- There is a color theme switcher in the header. By clicking on the switcher you can change color theme into light/dark. Initially, it's dark theme.
- It's full responsive.
